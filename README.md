# RestfulAPIBase
This is the first GO project that I have done, the bases for future API creation.
It uses Go and Gin as the web frame to be able to create the api.

For instructions of what the requirements are needed then refer to the go.mod file. As this will show the dependencies in which this program needs to work 
correctly. 

This project is open for anyone who wishes to create a GO api, but malicious tampering of the code will not be tolerated. Be mindful, of what you do
and of course enjoy the program.
